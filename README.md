## JAX CNN Models

Jax uses functional style approach where side effects are restricted to achieve better just in time compilation with XLA. More information on it at https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial2/Introduction_to_JAX.html

JAX CNN models are based on this tutorial with addition to time training and inference work loads https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html
